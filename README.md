# critter-bot
A box critters bot to follow your player. Based off of a Perl script I used in 2010 on Club Penguin.

## Usage
Run the bot: `go run .`

Login with your email and password

Type in your playerID (`world.player.playerId` in box critters javascript console to get this)

Move around and watch your critter follow you
